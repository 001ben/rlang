## Test environments

* local OS X install, R 3.1.2
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.1.2
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs.

## Downstream dependencies

I ran `R CMD check` on all 7 reverse dependencies (https://github.com/hadley/dplyr/tree/master/revdep/summary.md). As far as I can tell, there are no new problems.
