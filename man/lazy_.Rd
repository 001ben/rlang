\item{expr}{Expression to capture. For \code{lazy_} must be a name
or a call.}

\item{env}{Environment in which to evaluate expr.}
}
\description{
\code{lazy()} uses non-standard evaluation to turn promises into lazy
objects; \code{lazy_()} does standard evaluation and is suitable for
programming.
}
\examples{
lazy_(quote(a + x), globalenv())
lazy(a + b / c)

f <- function(x = b - a) {
  lazy(x)
}

f(a + b / c)
