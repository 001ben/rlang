\usage{
env_scope(env_nm)

env_scope_package(pkg)

env_scope_names()

is_scoped(env_nm)

env_scope_base()

env_scope_global()
}
\arguments{
\item{env_nm}{The name of an environment attached to the search
path. Call \code{\link[base]{search}()} to see what is currently
on the path.}

\item{pkg}{The name of a package.}
}
\description{
Scope environments are named environments which form a
parent-child hierarchy called the search path. They define what
objects you can see (are in scope) from your workspace. They
typically are package environments, i.e. special environments
containing all exported functions from a package (and whose parent
environment is the package namespace, which also contains
unexported functions). Package environments are attached to the
search path with \code{\link[base]{library}()}. Note however that
any environment can be attached to the search path, for example
with the unrecommended \code{\link[base]{attach}()} base function
which transforms vectors to scoped environments.
}
\details{
Scope environments form a chain with newly attached environments as
the childs of earlier ones. However, the global environment, where
everything you define at top-level ends up, is pinned as the head
of the linked list. Likewise, the base package environment is
always the tail of the chain. You can obtain those environments
with \code{env_scope_global()} and \code{env_scope_base()}
respectively.

You can list all scoped environments with
\code{env_scope_names()}. With \code{is_scoped()} you can check
whether a named environment is on the search
path. \code{env_scope_package()} returns the scope environment of
packages if they are attached to the search path, and throws an
error otherwise.
}
\examples{
# List the names of scoped environments:
nms <- env_scope_names()
nms

# The global environment is always the first in the chain:
env_scope(nms[[1]])

# And the scope environment of the base package is always the last:
env_scope(nms[[length(nms)]])

# These environments have their own shortcuts:
env_scope_global()
env_scope_base()

# Get the scope environment of a package:
env_scope_package("utils")
}
