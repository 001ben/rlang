# Benchmarks

There is some overhead of using `lazy()` instead of `substitute()`, however, on my computer it's on the order of around 1.5Âµs, so it's extremely unlikely to be a bottleneck in practice.

```{r}
library(microbenchmark)
library(lazy)

microbenchmark(
  substitute = substitute(x),
  lazy = lazy(x)
)
```
